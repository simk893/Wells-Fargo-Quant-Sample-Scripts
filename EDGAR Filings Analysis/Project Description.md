In this project I tried to replicate the summary statistics on the yahoo.finance premium subscription. Most of the data is cheaply extracted from publicly available SEC filings and then sold for $50 a month. I tried to avoid this cost by doing it myself, however I did not complete the project as I decided to prioritize other projects. I plan to pick this back up and add my own Sector/Industry/SubIndustry clustering and analysis of these filings to create an automatically and frequently updated database for managing my own investments. I also plan to use this data in combination with my FRED analysis project to one day build a predictive model to guide my investments.
